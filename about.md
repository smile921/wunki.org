![Headphones, Coding, Happy.](/images/writing-code.png)

Wunki is written by Petar Radošević, a '82 born Croatian living in the
Netherlands. If a persons reflection can be shown by the things they enjoy
doing in live, mine would be programming, reading books, running and watching
a movie with my girl.

Another part of my life evolves around [Bread and Pepper]. A company [Wouter],
[Joeri] and I started in 2009. We focus on developing software which is spicy
on the backend, but simple on the frontend.

## Sofware

Most of the tools I use are open source and I love the open culture of
software development. Take a look at my [Github page] to find
[django-userena], an account management application for [Django], my
[dotfiles] and some random bytes.

I do all my work on [Debian], staying in my editor [Emacs]. Favourite software
is thus [Emacs] for editing, mail, IRC and twitter. [Conkeror] for browsing
the web and [Org mode] to manage my tasks. Most of the day I'm listening to
[Di.fm] or [Somafm] radio.

## Peripherals

I develop on my Thinkpad X1 Carbon with enough RAM and a SSD harddisk. I keep
my servers running on [FreeBSD]. I do all my typing on a 
[Realforce 87U Tenkeyless] keyboard -- used for typing in [Dvorak] -- and listen
to music with [Sennheiser HD 380 Pro] headphones.
