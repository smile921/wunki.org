# About

![](/images/writing-code.png)

Wunki is written by Petar Radošević, a '82 born Croatian living in the
Netherlands. I spend most of my day write code in Clojure, Haskell and
Python.

## Sofware

Most of the tools I use are open source and the things I write can be found at
[Github]. Things get done in [Emacs] and I love to use [Org mode] to manage my
tasks. Most of the day I'm listening to [Di.fm] or [Somafm] radio.

## Peripherals

I develop on a Thinkpad X1 Carbon and do all my typing on a
[Realforce 87U Tenkeyless] keyboard -- I type in [Dvorak] -- while listening
to music with the [Sennheiser HD 380 Pro] headphones. I keep my servers
running on [FreeBSD]
