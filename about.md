Wunki is written by Petar Radošević, a '82 born Croatian living in the
Netherlands. I spend most of my day write code in Erlang, Clojure, Haskell and
Python. I use these languages for creating API's for a wide variety of projects.

## Sofware

Most of the tools I use are open source and the things I write can be found at
my [Github]. I do most my work in [Emacs] where I also love to use
[Org mode] to manage my tasks. Most of the day I'm
listening to [Di.fm] or [Somafm] radio.

## Peripherals

I develop on my Thinkpad X1 Carbon with enough RAM and a SSD harddisk. I keep
my servers running on [FreeBSD]. I do all my typing on a 
[Realforce 87U Tenkeyless] keyboard -- used for typing in [Dvorak] -- and listen
to music with [Sennheiser HD 380 Pro] headphones.
