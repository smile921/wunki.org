When building [Invy] with [Bread & Pepper] we had lengthy debates on how
a button should behave. This was not the case when we discussed monetization.
Since we all hated ads -- and making money from ads is getting harder thanks to
ad-cataract[^1] -- we were left with one option, charging money for it. It
seemed obvious at the time, that when you supply something of value, you receive
a compensation for the supplied value. We estimated the value for Invy at $1.99.
However, after launching [Invy], several people found this to be wrong, they
told us it should be "gratis" instead.

You can not argue that the adoption rate would be higher if [Invy] would be
free. The real question is, does it increase the value of [Invy]. Let me try
to explain why I believe this is not the case.

## Paying for Bread

When we get the question why we ask money for [Invy] we answer jokingly, but
as often with humor containing a core of truth: "We need money to buy
bread". You would think that it's obvious to ask money for Apps, but
developers are shooting their own foot by conditioning people to believe most
Apps should be free. Something we, developers, endorse by creating Apps which
ignore revenue:

> hopefully weâ€™ll never have to go down that road."
> -- <cite>[Gifture on TheNextWeb]</cite>

The above confused me when I read it for the first time because it seems to
ignore the ground rule for a business: _generating revenue_. I quickly
understood that they went with the revenue model where the _user is the
currency_. 

This switches the priority to amassing users and causes a deliberate choice to
ignore revenue because of its negative impact on the adoption rate. As more
businesses choose this approach, it's causing the consumer to form a connection
between _social_, _free_ and _ad-less_. A thing made popular by companies as
[Twitter].  A bleed over effect to other Apps will only strengthen the consumers
belief that Apps are gratis.

Developers choose this "business" model because it could potentially lead to
a valuation of 100 billion (Facebook) or a [sale for one billion] (Instagram).
The irony is that a sale -- counting as a success for the seller -- is mostly
a disappointment for the user because of the discontinuation of the service. The
consumers demand of free software and developers neglect of revenue creates
a self-reinforcing effect which benefits neither.

## Revenue has it's Perks

[Invy] has just sold it's 5.000th copy on the App store, something we would have
achieved sooner if we made it free. However, we still stand by our choice to ask
money. Out of necessity because we are bootstrapping and are living of our
savings and out of practicality because it increases the quality of our product.

A benefit of this model is the higher quality of feedback because users are
invested in the product and they want value for their money. The feedback
let's us improve the application and results in more units sold. The generated
revenue also keeps the service running while maintaining a natural growth. The
benefit for our users is that we don't need to look for an investment or
payout and can keep the service running as long as it's value stays proven.

Consumer and developer would benefit when Apps don't neglect revenue and lure
in users by presenting an unsustainable utopia made by bits. It's not only bad
for your product, but every outcome results in a disappointment for your
users. Now, spend some money on [our App], it only costs $1.99.

our brain to ignore ads.
