Let's continue in our series of creating, solid, [FreeBSD] server. This time
we will get our [Django] web application running on a symbiosis of [gunicorn],
[supervisor] and [nginx]. Nginx will run at the frontend and proxy the WSGI
requests to gunicorn. The gunicorn processes will be monitored by supervisord,
so that if one goes down, they will immediatly be put back up.

_Note: This guide continues where the previous guide
"[Solid FreeBSD Server: The Foundation]" ends. If you are creating a new
server, please follow the above guide first. It will show you how to do
updates and make your server more secure._

## Virtual environment

By following the "[Solid FreeBSD Server: The Foundation]" guide, we already
have an user account set up. Use this account to install your Django
applications. These will run in their own virtual enviroment with the help of
[virtualenv] and [virtualenvwrapper]. Let's install the packages through the
ports system, with the root user:

    cd /usr/ports/devel/py-virtualenv
    make install clean
    # And virtualenvwrapper..
    cd /usr/ports/devel/py-virtualenvwrapper
    make install clean

After installation, make sure you have the following in your shell config file
(``~/.bashrc`` if your using Bash, ``~/.zshrc`` if your using ZSH):

    # Virtualenvwrapper
    if [ -e /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh ]; then
        export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
        source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
    fi

Next time you will login with this user, you will see a message that the
``~/.virtualenvs`` directory is created and the scripts are placed there.

We will install our Django project in the ``~/apps`` directory (of the
previously created user). Let's start by pulling our django project.

    cd ~/apps
    mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages demoproject
    git clone git@github.com/wunki/demoproject.git

This will install a virtual environment in ``~/.virtualenvs/demoproject`` and
clone our project with git into the ``~/apps/demoproject`` directory.

### Dependencies

Next thing is to install the dependencies that are needed to run our django
project. Of course, Django itself, but it can easily grow to a big list of
Python packages. At [Bread & Pepper] we manage the project dependencies in two
[pip] requirements files, a ``requirements-stable.txt`` and a
``requirements.txt``. The ``requirements-stable.txt`` contains all the
dependencies, including the version number, that guarantee a running
application. For example:
    
    Django==1.3
    docutils==0.7
    django-tagging==0.3.1
    -e hg+https://bitbucket.org/david/django-storages@0db5aa65cc34#egg=storages

And the ``requirements.txt`` file is used for our development enviroment. If a
package is running stable there, we can bump up the version in the stable
requirements. You can read more about the requirements file format in the
[pip documentation]. Test if you can get your Django application running with
the ``manage.py`` command.

## Gunicorn

Our application can be started up with the ``runserver`` command from Django,
but this isn't a production ready server. For that purpose, we are going to
install gunicorn in our virtual environment. Make sure that the environment is
active and if not, activate it with ``workon demoproject``.

You can now install gunicorn with:

    pip install gunicorn

After installation, you can either run gunicorn with the ``manage.py``
command, or with it's own ``gunicorn`` command. We will use the ``manage.py``
command, and for this to work we need to append ``gunicorn`` to our
``INSTALLED_APPS`` tuple in ``settings.py``. After that, try running your
application with ``./manage.py run_gunicorn``. We want to have some additional
settings that we will place in ``gunicorn.conf.py`` file inside our project
directory. This is my gunicorn configuration:

~~~ {.python}
import os

def numCPUs():
    if not hasattr(os, "sysconf"):
        raise RuntimeError("No sysconf detected.")
    return os.sysconf("SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN")

user = <your-user>
workers = numCPUs() * 2 + 1
bind = "127.0.0.1:8000"
pidfile = "/tmp/gunicorn-demo.pid"
backlog = 2048
logfile = "home/<your-user>/log/gunicorn_demo.log"
loglevel = "info"
~~~

If that starts up, we want to proxy to this server with our nginx server.

## Nginx

Continue by installing nginx (pronounced "engine-x") proxy. Go to you root
account by issuing ``su`` and supplying the root password. Install it through
the ports system with the following commands:

    cd /usr/ports/www/nginx
    make install clean

This installs the latest stable version, at the moment of writing, 1.0.4., of
nginx. Let the server boot at startup by adding it to your ``/etc/rc.conf``:

    nginx_enable="YES"

You can start the server with the following command:

    /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nginx start

If you have opened up port 80 (HTTP) in your Amazon security group, you should
see the message "Welcome to nginx" when you open the domain in your browser.

Let's create a proxy inside nginx that will redirect incoming traffic (port
80) to our local gunicorn (port 8000). Open up
``/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`` and replace the ``server`` section with
the following:

~~~ {.shell}
server {
  listen       80;
  server_name  www.mydomain.com;
  access_log   /var/log/nginx/nginx-access.log;
        
  location  /media/ {
    root /home/user/apps/demo;
  }
  
  location / {
    proxy_pass   http://127.0.0.1:8000;
  }
}
~~~

This is a minimal configuration that will accomplish the following; when the
browser requests the ``/media/`` path, nginx will return static files located
in ``/home/user/apps/demo/media/`` directory. Following that is the proxy
location which will handle all the remaining requests and proxy them to
gunicorn. When you have customized the above config for your own needs,
restart the nginx server as root with ``/usr/local/etc/rc.d/nginx
restart``. If you don't receive any warnings from nginx, start up your
gunicorn process, this time with your user account, and open your domain in
the browser. You should now be able to see your Django project. The main
things are working right now, we only don't want to manually start our
gunicorn processes. For this we need the final piece in the stack,
[supervisor].

### Supervisor

[Supervisor] is a management tool for processes. We will use it to monitor our
gunicorn deamons and make sure they stay up. If a process goes down,
supervisor will start it again. We can install supervisor through the ports
tree:

    cd /usr/ports/sysutils/py-supervisor
    make install clean

To enable supervisor at startup, we will need to add the following to our
``/etc/rc.conf`` file:

    supervisord_enable="YES"

Next thing is to tell supervisor to spin up our gunicorn and keep watching
it. We do this by adding our service to
``/usr/local/etc/supervisord.conf``. Add the following at the bottom:

    [program:demo]
    directory=/home/user/apps/demo
    command=/home/user/.virtualenvs/demo/bin/gunicorn_django -c /home/user/apps/demo/gunicorn.conf.py settings_production.py
    user=user
    umask=022
    autostart=True
    autorestart=True
    redirect_stderr=True

Most important setting of the above is the ``command`` setting. This should
point to the ``gunicorn_django`` executable of the virtual enviroment of
yourproject, following the gunicorn settings file, finally followed by the
django settings file for this server.

## Conclusion

That's all there is to it to get Django deployed on a FreeBSD server. We are
currently running our services on the above server and are really happy with
the results. Want to speed things up? Look at caching, optimizing queries and
using a loadbalancer. For a starting web application, the above will suffice...
