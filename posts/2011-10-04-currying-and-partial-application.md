A few days ago I wrote a post with the same subject as this one. Being proud
of the result I decided to post it on [Reddit] so others could learn from my
thorough understanding on the subject. Boy, was I wrong.

Luckily, the Haskell community is one of teachers and I received valuable
feedback about the correct meaning of currying. Although I needed some time to
recover from my initial failure, it would be foolish to leave it at that. So,
with all the feedback printed and annotated, here goes my second try at
explaining _currying_ and _partial function_ application.

## What is currying?

Currying is a technique which transforms a function that takes a tuple into
chained functions which each take one parameter. This is shown in the type
declarion of the ``curry`` function:

~~~ {.haskell}
curry :: ((a, b) -> c) -> a -> b -> c
~~~

When applying ``curry`` to the function ``foo``, we get a function which is the same as ``bar``.

~~~ {.haskell}
foo :: (Int, Int) -> Int
foo (a, b) = a * b

bar :: Int -> Int -> Int
bar a = \b -> a * b
~~~

The reason we call ``foo`` uncurried, is because it takes a single tuple as
argument and returns the value. Also visible because of the single ``->`` in
the type declaration. Left of this is the single argument, consisting of
multiple components.

``bar`` is the curried form of ``foo`` because it takes the first element of
the pair in ``foo`` and returns a function which takes the second element of
the pair, and finally gives you back the same value that you would get using
``foo``. The function ``bar`` is thus transformed into a function which
accepts a single parameter and returns a function which again, accepts a
single parameter.

Although it may seem that the following function is uncurried, this is not the
case because it's only different in syntax from the function ``bar`` above:

~~~ {.haskell}
baz :: Int -> Int -> Int
baz a b = a * b
~~~

You can see it has the same type declaration as ``bar``. But not only is the
type declaration the same, follow along to see that they both return the same
values:

~~~ {.haskell} 
-- Our new function
baz :: Int -> Int -> Int
baz a b = a * b

-- The same function, but this time the y
-- is replaced by a anonymous function
bar a = \b -> a * b

-- So, if we supply arguments to the function.
-- Having an x of 2.
bar 2 = \y -> 2 + y

-- And an y of 3.
-- Returns a value of 5
bar 2 = (\y -> 2 + y) 3
~~~

Let's try the same with a function that multiplies three numbers, thus
allowing us to create three chained functions, all accepting a single
parameter.

~~~ {.haskell}
multThree :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
multThree x y z = x * y * z
~~~

We could also write the _function type_ of multThree as follows:

~~~ {.haskell}
multThree :: Int -> (Int -> (Int -> Int))
~~~

You should read this as a function that takes an ``Int`` and returns a
function which itself takes an ``Int``, which again returns a function which
takes an ``Int`` and finally returns just an ``Int``. Quite a mouthful, but
let's follow this logic in code to clarify that it's gives the same result as
the following chained function.

~~~ {.haskell}
-- The chained version of multTree
multThree' x = \y -> \z -> x * y * z

-- Let's replace the x with the value 5
multThree' 5 = \y -> \z -> 5 * y * z
~~~

This shows that ``multThree' 5`` returns a function which accepts a single
parameter and returns a function which multiplies this parameters with 5. One
level deeper, also supplying the second argument ``y``:

~~~ {.haskell}
multThree' 5 = (\y -> (\z -> 5 * y * z)) 7 
~~~

Returns a function which accepts one argument, and returns that argument
multiplied 35 times. Supplying all three arguments finally returns a value:

~~~ {.haskell}
multThree' 5 = (\y -> (\z -> 5 * y * z) 11) 7
~~~

I hope it's clear that although the functions are both syntacticly different,
they are the same and return the same results when all arguments are
supplied. Although functions in Haskell seem to accept multiple arguments,
**all** functions are considered curried and thus **accept a single
parameter**. This makes it possible to use partial function applications.

## Partial function application

As we have seen, supplying less arguments to a function that takes multiple --
at leasts seems to -- arguments returns a function which takes as many
parameters as we have left out. This is called, _partially applied_
functions. Let's show an example where we create a function which returns the
sum of two parameters and then create a new function that always adds seven to
it.

~~~ {.haskell}
sumTwo x y = x + y
addSeven = sumTwo 7
~~~

Notice that the ``addSeven`` function doesn't seem to require any
parameters. This is a false assumption however when you consider what the
partial application of ``sumTwo`` returns.

~~~ {.haskell}
addSeven = sumTwo 7
addSeven = \y -> 7 + y
~~~

Because only one parameter is supplied to the ``sumTwo`` function, another
function is returned which requires one more parameter. The above shows the
``addSeven`` expression is a function that takes one parameter and adds seven
to it. To take it even further, this allows you to leave out parameters when
your functions supplies the parameters to an inner function, for example:

~~~ {.haskell}
sum :: (Num a) => [a] -> a
sum = foldl (+) 0
~~~

Again, the above seems to indicate that ``sum`` function doesn't take any
parameters. But a closer look reveals that the ``foldl`` function is partially
applied because it requires three parameters to return a value and it only
receives two. This also reveals the following general rule.

~~~ {.haskell}
foo a = bar 2 a
-- is the same as..
foo = bar 2
~~~

Partial function application allows you to re-use functions and chain them
together. For example, in [Real World Haskell] the example is given of a
function called ``isInAny`` which checks if a list can be found in another
list. The function starts as such:

~~~ {.haskell}
isInAny needle haystack = any inSequence haystack
    where inSequence s = needle `isInfixOf` s
~~~

<section class="information">

### Prefix or Infix

Prefix or infix are ways to supply your functions with arguments. Prefix
functions begin with the function name, followed by it's arguments while infix
functions are surrounded by their arguments. An example of an infix function
is the ``+``. Haskell allows you to change prefix functions which take two
arguments to infix by surrounding them with `` ` ``.

</section>

The ``any`` function checks if at least one item in the list ``haystack``
fullfils the condition which is supplied with ``inSequence`` check. Definition
of ``inSequence`` is supplied in the ``where`` clausule and uses the _infix_
function ``isInfixOf``. This is a function which accepts two lists and returns
``True`` if the first list is, wholly and intact, contained anywhere in the
second list. Thus checking if the list supplied with ``needle`` is part of the
list ``haystack``. We could shorten this function by using a lambda function
instead of the ``where`` clausule:

~~~ {.haskell}
isInAny needle haystack = any (\s -> needle `isInfixOf` s) haystack
~~~

Hereby the ``isInfixOf`` is supplied with the ``haystack`` through the ``s``
parameter. But.. since we know how partially applied functions work, we could
shorten this function even further:

~~~ {.haskell}
isInAny needle haystack = any (isInfixOf needle) haystack
~~~

Because ``(isInfixOf needle)`` is a partially applied function, it returns a
function which accepts the remaining arguments. The one remaining argument for
this function is thus supplied with ``haystack``.
